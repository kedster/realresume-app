# RealResume App
This is the RealResume MVP platform.
RealResume App
Overview
RealResume is a micro-SaaS platform designed to host active, verified resumes without posting jobs. The platform allows job seekers to upload their resumes (Word or PDF), verifies the authenticity and freshness of resumes with daily check-ins, and provides recruiters with a searchable database of candidates actively looking for work.

This MVP focuses on the core features to enable resume upload, malicious document scanning, automated daily email confirmations, and a recruiter-facing search function. It is built with Next.js and React for scalability, ease of deployment, and modern web standards.

Features
Resume Upload: Users (job seekers) upload resumes as Word or PDF files.

Malicious File Scanning: Server-side scanning to prevent harmful uploads.

Active Resume Validation: Daily automated emails to seekers to confirm they are still available; resumes are removed if no confirmation.

Resume Search: Recruiters can search the text content of all active resumes based on keywords or technologies.

User Profiles:

Job Seekers: Can only upload resumes and respond to daily check-in emails.

Recruiters: Can search and view resumes but cannot upload or modify them.

Admins: Full control including user management and system oversight.

Tech Team: Manage blacklisting of resumes, emails, and phone numbers violating terms.

Authentication: Separate methods for seekers, recruiters, admins, and tech roles with role-based access control.

Blacklist Management: Tech role can manually block/unblock resumes or contact info violating terms of service.

Tech Stack
Frontend & Backend: Next.js (React framework) with TypeScript

Authentication: JWT or OAuth (to be implemented)

File Storage: Cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob, or equivalent recommended)

Malicious File Scanning: Integration with antivirus scanning services or libraries

Database: Relational DB like PostgreSQL or a NoSQL option for resume and user data

Email Service: SMTP or transactional email provider (SendGrid, AWS SES) for daily check-ins

Hosting: Cloudflare Pages can host static frontend; backend requires a serverless or container-based environment (e.g., Vercel, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)

Dev Tools: Git + GitHub for version control, PowerShell for environment setup and deployment scripting

npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the welcome page.

Core Development Roadmap (MVP)
Feature	Status	Notes
Resume upload form	Planned	Support Word & PDF
Server-side file scanning	Planned	Virus/malware scan integration
Resume storage & database	Planned	Store text content & metadata
Daily "still looking?" email system	Planned	Email automation and removal logic
Recruiter search interface	Planned	Full text search on resumes
User authentication & roles	Planned	Separate seeker, recruiter, admin
Admin/Tech blacklist management	Planned	Manual block/release by tech role

Authentication & Roles
Job Seeker: Can only upload resumes and respond to daily confirmation emails.

Recruiter: Can search and view active resumes.

Admin: Full system control; manage users, view logs, and system health.

Tech: Manage blacklist entries and flagged resumes/contact info.

Deployment Notes
Frontend hosting: Cloudflare Pages can host static frontend assets.

Backend: Requires server or serverless platform to run API, scanning, email jobs.

Database & storage: Must be provisioned externally (AWS RDS, Azure SQL, etc.).

Email provider: Use transactional email service for daily resume confirmation emails.

Security: HTTPS required, secure storage of user data, and compliance with privacy laws.

PowerShell Setup Script
A PowerShell script (setup-realresume.ps1) is provided to create the minimal folder structure and essential files:

pages/index.tsx

package.json

tsconfig.json

.gitignore

README.md

Run the script in PowerShell to scaffold the project.

# RealResume MVP Project Workflow

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundations

**Goal:** Establish the project structure, version control, and core tools.

- [X] Initialize GitHub repo (`realresume-app`).
- [X] Scaffold bare minimum Next.js + TypeScript app.
- [X] Create essential files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, `pages/index.tsx`).
- [X] Write README with project overview and instructions.
- [X] Set up basic Git workflow and branch strategy (e.g., `main`, `dev`, feature branches).

---

## Phase 2: Authentication & User Roles

**Goal:** Implement basic authentication and role management to distinguish job seekers, recruiters, admins, and tech users.

- [ ] Define user roles and permissions.
- [ ] Choose authentication method (JWT, OAuth, or third-party like Auth0).
- [ ] Implement signup/login flow for job seekers (upload-only).
- [ ] Implement recruiter login with search access.
- [ ] Implement admin and tech logins with expanded privileges.
- [ ] Add role-based route protection in Next.js.

---

## Phase 3: Resume Upload & Storage

**Goal:** Allow job seekers to upload resumes (Word/PDF), store securely, and extract text for search.

- [ ] Create file upload component for seekers.
- [ ] Validate file types and size client-side.
- [ ] Implement server-side malicious file scanning integration.
- [ ] Store files securely (consider cloud storage like AWS S3).
- [ ] Extract text content from uploaded files for database indexing.
- [ ] Save resume metadata and extracted text to database.

---

- [ ] Develop search UI with filters for keywords, technologies, etc.
- [ ] Implement backend search API querying the indexed text database.
- [ ] Display results with resume summaries (no direct upload or edit).
- [ ] Add pagination and sorting features for usability.

---

## Phase 5: Daily “Still Looking” Confirmation System

**Goal:** Automate daily emails to job seekers to confirm active status; remove inactive resumes.

# Tips for Staying Focused

- Break down each phase into smaller tasks or tickets.
- Use a project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello, GitHub Projects).
- Set daily or weekly goals aligned with this workflow.
- Regularly commit code and document progress.
